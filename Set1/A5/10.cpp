// Inheritance has lot of advantages, It allows for better management of different data with some degree of 
// reusuability of common codes, Moreover it also increased the readibility and logic of problem, while reducing
// the lines of code written!

// Inheritance also have some disadvantages, namely that the functions in inheritance usually runs slower because
// there's a degree of redirection, also since it is coupled with base class, a simple change might break the logic
// and workflow of whole program!! Not only that but there's also memory wastage in case there is inheritance but
// members of inherited class are not much used.
