// Compiler -> Compiles code, turn it into another language and does all this in one go

// Interpreter -> Runs instructions line by line in order, doesn't convert code to another language

// Compile time error -> Error found by compiler when compiling the program, These are usually syntax
// or syntactic errors

// Run time error -> Error generated during execution of program, Maybe due to wrong code logic or incorrectly
// sanitized inputs

// Syntax versus semantic bug -> Syntax bug where you forgot colon(;) or some other tokens while programming, 
// whereas in semantic the code runs and syntax is right, but it doesn't do the thing it is required, ie Undeclared variable

// Procedural oriented programming vs ... -> In pop the code is written by breaking data into variables and different 
// fields, Whereas in OOP the consideration is given to Object (Ie data holders), Data is organized and stored in
// instance of containers (ie objects) which is defined from class
